=== Node.js Debugger 

Users can now debug Node.js applications deployed to Openshift. All you need to do is create a *Server Adapter* for the application and run it in the *Debug* mode. A new *V8* debug session will then be created:

Put some breakpoints in the code and then you can start debugging.

==== Steps by steps instructions

===== Step 1: Deploy the nodejs:latest builder 

Using the `Openshift Explorer`, deploy a new application using the nodejs:latest builder image. Once deployed, the Openshift explorer should look like this:

Import the application source code into your workspace so that you can set breakpoints.

===== Step 2: Create the server adapter

Select the `nodejs` service, right-click and select the `Server adapter` menu item. An `Openshift Server Adapter Settings` dialog will display, click the
`Finish` button. The server adater will be created and the `Servers` view will look like this:

===== Step 3: Restart the server adapter in debug mode

In order to debug Javascript code, the server adapter must be restarted in debug mode. Select the server adapter, right-click and select the `Restart in Debug` menu item.
The `Servers` view will look like this:

===== Step 4: Add a breakpoint into the server code

Open the `server.js` file located in the `nodejs-ex` project that you imported in Step 1. Around line 79, the handler for the *pagecount* is defined so you can add
a breakpoint in the following lines (line 82 for the first instruction).

===== Step 5: Open the web browser

In the `Openshift Explorer`, select the `nodejs` service, and select `Show in -> Web Browser`. The home page for the application will be displayed:

===== Step 6: Debug your Javascript code

Add *pagecount* at the end of the URL in the location toolbar and press *ENTER*. This will trigger Javascript debugging as you setup a breakpoint in Step 4. 
Depending on your Eclipse settings, you may see a dialog asking to switch to the debug perspective:

If you see this dialog, press *ENTER* and the debug perspective will be shown. If you don't see this dialog, then the debug perspective is directly shown.

Changing the code during the debug session is also supported. To change the code, save the file and new changes will be applied automatically. Here is a short demo video that shows the debugging process in action:
