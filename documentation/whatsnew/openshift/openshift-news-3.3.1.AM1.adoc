=== Common namespace is now configurable
When looking for Openshift resources (builder images, templates), a common namespace is browsed.
Earlier hardcoded `openshift` namespace is now configurable with default value `openshift`.

WARNING: Please note that templates are still loaded from the `openshift` namespace and not from the configured common namespace, this will be fixed for the next release.

You can access and modify it through the connection extended properties:

=== CDK server using native terminal for better user interactions

The CDK server adapter now uses a native terminal that allows better interaction with the user. In case the credentials are not passed in the Vagrant environment, the user will be asked to ENTER the login credentials (similar to the standard Vagrant CLI) and in case of registration failures, retries will be performed.

First, ensure that your CDK server adapter is configured not to pass credentials:

Start the CDK server adapter and a new terminal window will open asking for registration:

If you answered `y` to the previous questions, the terminal window will ask for the username:

The terminal window will then ask for the password:

If the registration fails, the terminal window will retry and ask for the username and password:
